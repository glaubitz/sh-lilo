* Use of LILO in cross development environment

Here's lilo.conf which I use:
------------------------------
linear
compact
# Cross LILO
# Actually, it's /dev/hda
boot = /dev/hdc
disk = /dev/hdc
  bios=0x80
#
delay = 30
vga = normal
image = /boot/vmlinuz
	label = linux
	root = /dev/hda1
	read-only
------------------------------

As of SH BIOS 0.3, only LBA access is supported.  So, you must need
"linear" line.

In my cross environment, Compact Flash card is accessed as the device
/dev/hdc at the host.  This disk is shown as /dev/hda at the target
side.  I specify "boot = /dev/hdc" to write the MBR and `map' file in
the disk of /dev/hdc (at the host).  However, since the disk is shown
as /dev/hda at the target machine, special care is needed (or else,
/dev/hdc would be accessed in the target too).  That's the trick two
lines: "disk = /dev/hdc ... bios = 0x80", where 0x80 means /dev/hda
for BIOS.  With these lines, disk geometry uses 0x80 (/dev/hda).

If you mount /dev/hdc at /mnt, the invocation of LILO is:

	# lilo -r /mnt

You need to have /mnt/etc/lilo.conf and /mnt/dev/hdc, /mnt/dev/hda1 and
other files in the target disk under /mnt.
